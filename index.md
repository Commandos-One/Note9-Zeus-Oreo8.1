## Welcome to THEBOSS World!

All kind of kernel optimization and speed... chosen carefully and precisely... collected and optimized specifically for our beloved Note 9 (N960F/FD) with a touch of love & passion... 


[- Overclocking is about the passion, not about how much you clock]
[- Overclocking is not about the performance gains, it is about the passion]



Changelogs and Updates:-
- Disabled vaultkeeper through ramdisk modification for being useless & less bloat
- Disabled bunch of security options that proved through my experience causes overhead or performance degradation in general usage or operations
- Disabled Unnecessary option or features that are not being used
- Updated CPU scaling for more battery life while still using 2.0Ghz litter cores & 2.9Ghz big cores frequencies
- Undervolted GPU more across all frequencies for better power saving & less heat [Although no heat issues are reported] :)
- Optimized & Cleaned the Code further using my own method;)
- Improved CPU idle power consumption.. (means more battery savings!)
- Optimized CPU for big.LITTLE cores flags & executions
- Removed all kinds of logging , debugging, tracing,etc... for smooth operation
- GPU OC up to 775Mhz while taking consideration on voltage.. [Customized Voltage] (Might be unstable if G3D ----ASV value under 4!!] (You Have Been Warned]
- OC CPU Big to 2.9Ghz and Small to 2Ghz
- Customized CPU Buses to reflect real world usage and to decrease power consumption
- Customized CPU freq scaling for more battery life and decreased power consumption
- This kernel made for Gaming on Mind.. so expect higher FPS performance [Depends on your ASV level]
- Safety mechanism is not touched to avoid hardware damage
- CPU is more intelligent for keeping apps for little cores and heavy game are for BIG cores [with decreased Power & Heat]
- All kind of security is disabled
- Complied with the latest GCC Compiler Clang 8.3 for speed & better optimization
- IO & TCP mostly all available
- Always updated to the latest linux upstream version
- There is soo much more.. I can't remember...You tell me... :D
