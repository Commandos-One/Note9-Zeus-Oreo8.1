# Intro
All kind of kernel optimization and speed and battery life... combination of **A**ll **I**n **O**ne Kernel-**AIO**! Chosen carefully and precisely... collected and optimized specifically for our beloved Note 9 (N960F/FD) with a touch of love & passion... 

# Appreciation and Credits-VIP
Thanks for the help from my friend @Tike420 who helped me and motivated me to push N9 kernel development forward.. he was the one who is testing my kernels and also he is the one who wanted to build TWRP with F2FS support but we got into issues.. but he was the one who also guided me for F2FS related source codes and alot of things too! 

Also we are the first who brough F2FS to our beloved device Note9.. if we wasn't here.. no body will ever do it or even think about it due to misconcept & misinformation that most developers realizes which is 5 words [It is not worth it] well.. we proved them wrong and other kernel developers got intersted and included it there own kernel.. lol even TWRP got F2FS support because of us now! this is also proves that laziness is not the right thing to do.

So.. **We started the spark.. We started the fire! (^.^)**

# Changelogs
Changelogs and Updates:-
- Fully Supports F2FS to ./data & ./cache ;)
- Disabled vaultkeeper through ramdisk modification for being useless & less bloat
- Disabled bunch of security options that proved through my experience causes overhead or performance degradation in general usage or operations
- Disabled Unnecessary option or features that are not being used
- Updated CPU scaling for more battery life while still using 2.0Ghz litter cores & 2.9Ghz big cores frequencies
- Undervolted GPU more across all frequencies for better power saving & less heat [Although no heat issues are reported] :)
- Optimized & Cleaned the Code further using my own method;)
- Improved CPU idle power consumption.. (means more battery savings!)
- Optimized CPU for big.LITTLE cores flags & executions
- Removed all kinds of logging , debugging, tracing,etc... for smooth operation
- GPU OC up to 775Mhz while taking consideration on voltage.. [Customized Voltage] (Might be unstable if G3D ----ASV value under 4!!] (You Have Been Warned]
- OC CPU Big to 2.9Ghz and Small to 2Ghz
- Customized CPU Buses to reflect real world usage and to decrease power consumption
- Customized CPU freq scaling for more battery life and decreased power consumption
- This kernel made for Gaming on Mind.. so expect higher FPS performance [Depends on your ASV level]
- Safety mechanism is not touched to avoid hardware damage
- CPU is more intelligent for keeping apps for little cores and heavy game are for BIG cores [with decreased Power & Heat]
- All kind of security is disabled
- Complied with the latest GCC Compiler Clang 8.3 [Modded Special Version Made By ME] for speed & better optimization
- IO & TCP mostly all available
- Always updated to the latest linux upstream version
- There is soo much more.. I can't remember...You tell me... :D


## Updates Frequency
To know how much I update this kerenl.. just simply follow me and also I update it through my free time... so... expect some delays!

I'm not responible for anything... you should know what you are doing and if you don't know what you are doing.. then you shouldn't even root your smartphone on the first place!
